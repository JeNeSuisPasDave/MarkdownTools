# This file includes one other

This is a root file. It includes `mm.mmd`.

# This file also includes one other

This is **not** a root file. It does, however, include `mmm.mmd`.

# This file includes no other

This is a partial file. It includes no other file.

And this is the last line of `mmm.mmd`.

And this is the last line of `mm.mmd`.

And this is the last line of `m.mmd`.
