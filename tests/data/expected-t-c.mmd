# This file includes one other

This is a root file. It includes `t-example.cpp`.

```
// function example
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int addition (int a, int b)
{
  int r;
  r=a+b;
  return r;
}

int main ()
{
  int z;
  z = addition (5,3);
  cout << "The result is " << z;
}
```

And this is the last line of `t-c.mmd`.
